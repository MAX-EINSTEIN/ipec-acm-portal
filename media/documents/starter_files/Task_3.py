# a) Calculate the temperature altitude from a list of temperatures
"""
Given a list of temperatures of one day, calculate the temperature amplitude (difference between highest and lowest temperature). Keep in mind that sometimes there might be a sensor error (represented as 'error').
"""

temperatures = [3, -20, -6, -12, 'error', 24, 18, 28, 16, 14]

# b) Count frequency of every character in a string (using dictionaries)
"""
Take a string as input from the user (for eg: 'abcccedeEEdffaG') and count the frequency each characters occurs in the string.

NOTE: Covert the string to upper or lower case first.
"""

# c) Verify De Morgan Laws (using sets)
"""
Given a Universal Set 'U', and two of its subsets 'A' and 'B'
Verify the De Morgan laws using sets. 

# De Morgan Laws:
not (A or B) = not A and not B
not (A and B) = not A or not B

NOTE: Use the inbuilt operators/methods for set operations (intersection, union, difference, ...)
NOTE: Complement of a set 'X' is the difference: 'U' - 'X'
